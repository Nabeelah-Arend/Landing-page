    <h2>About</h2>
    <div class="about the dr">
        <p>I qualified as a medical doctor in 2007. I developed an interest in obstetrics and gynaecology during my internship at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital and subsequently completed my community service at Mowbray Maternity Hospital.

            Through the University of Cape Town, I went on to earn my Fellowship in obstetrics and gynaecology with a distinction in the Masters of Medicine Degree. Thereafter I worked at Groote Schuur Hospital as a consultant in the the andrology lab, family planning, gynaecology outpatient, mature women and endocrine clinics.
            
            I have been involved in research in the Fertility Field and enjoy constantly challenging myself. I have a special interest in laparoscopic surgery and have pursued further training under the international GESEA foundation.</p>

        <p>My Passion to Practice
            Little compares to the sacrifices of women. It is a privilege and honour to serve women supportively through their complex and evolving life journey from adolescence to the matured years. While the various phases of life require different gynaecological care, I place emphasis on empowerment through health education and awareness.</p>
